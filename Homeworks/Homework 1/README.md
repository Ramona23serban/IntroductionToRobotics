# Components
•RGB LED (1)
•Potentiometers (3)
•Resistors and wires as needed

# Technical Task
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to read  the  potentiometer’s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.
