# Description

The project presents a clock and an alarm. The clock is initially set from the code, but can be changed by pressing the first button. A message will be displayed on the LCD Display, followed by the current time. By pressing the first button we will enter the Set Time menu. 
From this menu we can set the clock to the desired time. From the second button we increase the hour, minutes, seconds.
From the third button we move the cursor to hour/minutes/seconds, and from the fourth button we will set AM/PM.
Pressing the first button again we will enter the main menu, from where now pressing the second button we enter Set Alarm menu.
Here we can set the desired alarm as on the clock, from the same buttons as in the Set Time menu.
It is activated once we press the first button, returning to the main menu.
When the clock reaches the time at which the alarm is set, the buzzer will start to sound and our LED will light up. To turn off the alarm, press the fourth button.
The whole process can be repeated afterwards or changed even after the alarm is set.
