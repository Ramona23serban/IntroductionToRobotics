# Description

The project is made up of an ultrasonic sensor, buzzer and LEDs. The idea is that when the sensor detects an object, the LEDs light up in different colors, based on the distance.
If it is less than 50 cm, the blue light turns on, if it is less than 20 cm, blue+yellow lights up, and if it is less than 10 cm, all three light up.
The buzzer will emit sounds only when the sensor detects an object less than 20 cm from it.
