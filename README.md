# IntroductionToRobotics
Laboratory assignments in the "Introduction to Robotics" course, taken during the third year at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

# Homework 1

# Components
•RGB LED (1)
•Potentiometers (3)
•Resistors and wires as needed

# Technical Task
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometer’s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.
